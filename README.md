# What is MatPlotLib? 
  
Matplotlib is a plotting library for the Python programming language and its numerical mathematics extension NumPy. It provides an object-oriented API for embedding plots into applications using general-purpose GUI toolkits like Tkinter, wxPython, Qt, or GTK+. There is also a procedural "pylab" interface based on a state machine (like OpenGL), designed to closely resemble that of MATLAB, though its use is discouraged. SciPy makes use of Matplotlib.
 
Matplotlib was originally written by John D. Hunter, has an active development community, and is distributed under a BSD-style license. It was first released in 2003. The official website is www.matplotlib.org. 
 
# What is Matplotlib PyPlot?
 
matplotlib.pyplot is a collection of command style functions that make matplotlib work like MATLAB. Each pyplot function makes some change to a figure 
 
For Example, creates a figure, creates a plotting area in a figure, plots some lines in a plotting area, decorates the plot with labels, etc.
 
In matplotlib.pyplot various states are preserved across function calls, so that it keeps track of things like the current figure and plotting area, and the plotting functions are directed to the current axes (please note that "axes" here and in most places in the documentation refers to the axes part of a figure and not the strict mathematical term for more than one axis).
